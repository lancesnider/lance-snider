      <h2>Rive Developer Relations Engineer - Web</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a jack of all trades with career experience that seems tailor made
        for this role. Not only have I been an illustrator, developer
        (web/mobile/extension/game), and interactive motion designer since the
        Flash days, I spent almost 10 years doing developer relations for the
        Envato Marketplaces and the Milkshake mobile website builder.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that Rive is going to transform the way we interact with the
        web. There is going to be a massive amount of work for developers on
        everything from marketing websites to web games. I’m especially excited
        to see how Rive will change the way we learn online.
      </p>
      <p>
        We just need to let developers know what’s possible, spark their
        creativity, and give them the tools they need and Rive for web is going
        to take over.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that I have the skills, experience, and the passion to make
        Rive web what it absolutely needs to be.
      </p>

      <h2>Key skills and experience</h2>
      <p>
        10 years of experience as Content Growth Manager of the Envato
        Marketplaces and the Milkshake mobile web builder. These roles were a
        hybrid of developer, developer relations manager, and evangelist. I
        spoke at meetups, recruited developers, and wrote articles and
        tutorials. I also built and managed the building of tools to improve our
        products and make them more useful to our developers.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Side note about marketplaces like Envato: At some point developers are
        going to start selling Rive assets and tools as stock. I have a ton of
        experience with the strange word of stock assets and the power they have
        to help and hurt a tool like Rive.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        20 years of experience building interactive training modules (Skywest &
        Delta airlines), interactive marketing sites (Right Guard, NBA, Zicam,
        Estee Lauder), games (web, VR & iOS) and adding motion to the web. I
        understand that motion is one of the most powerful storytelling tools,
        even if the motion is just a simple animated transition.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I’m an artist who understands the importance of great
        aesthetics and the role that pictures play in effective storytelling.
        Not much makes me happier than good docs, readable pull requests, and
        comprehensive testing (including visual testing)
      </p>
      <p>
        I spend a lot of time thinking about responsiveness and web
        accessibility - 2 things that Rive and its community of web developers
        absolutely need to get right. Not sure this is a “key skill” but, I want
        you to know that I’m passionate about making web development more
        accessible to non-native English speakers. By simplifying the language
        we use, we can improve the learning experience for English and
        non-English speakers alike.
